# Automating Creative AI for Accessible Image Editing
This project is a collaboration with Yum Me Print and utilizes Google Nano Banana to enable text-based editing or content generation through simple, natural language prompts. The proposed system offers a user-friendly and secure portrait editing workflow that eliminates the need for manual prompts. By automatically analyzing input images and employing a verification framework, the system delivers consistent edits while preserving the subject’s identity.
