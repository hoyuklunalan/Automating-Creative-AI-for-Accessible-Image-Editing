# Automating Creative AI for Accessible Image Editing
This project is a collaboration with Yum Me Print to let users edit their images using simple, natural language prompts. A common problem with AI models is that creating good prompts takes time and expertise, and poor prompts can result in low-quality image edits. This project aims to reduce manual work for users by allowing them to easily select and customize features using Nano Banana generative models for image editing. The system also verifies whether the generated images match with prompt.<br />

This project can dividend into 4 part:<br />
